# Turris 1.0/1.1

Turris 1.X is a powerful router that was part of Turris security research
programme. It was based on **Freescale P2020 CPU**. It was dual core PPC CPU
running at **1.2 GHz**. It was shipped wit **two gigs of RAM** in SO-DIMM slot.
As a storage it used **256 MB NAND** memory.

## Difference between 1.0 and 1.1

There are few small differences between version 1.0 and 1.1. The most obvious
one is that case is a little different. But there are functional differences as
well. 1.0 used 7.5 V power supply while 1.1 used 12 V. Also 1.1 had on top of
1.0 USB 3 port directly accessible and contained SIM slot, so you could use LTE
modem inside.
