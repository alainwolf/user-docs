# Turris Omnia Revisions

Turris Omnia router received during its manufacturing and public sale various
little or even more significant changes. It is a list of revisions and notes on
those changes from the user's perspective.

To find the exact revision of Turris Omnia, you can look at the markings on PCB.
In front of the board on the right side, just behind LEDs, you will see the code
`CZ11NIC**`.


## CZ11NIC13

It is the first publicly available revision of Turris Omnia. It was sent to
backers from the Indiegogo campaign and was also the first batch available in
retail stores.

Routers from the campaign were provided to users in chassis of various colors
and possibly even without chassis altogether as board only. In retail shops, the
only available version was with black chassis.

Omnias were available with or without Wi-Fi and in configurations with 1GB and
2GB memory.


## CZ11NIC20

It was the first revamp of Turris Omnia. The primary change was that instead of
two, there were four RAM chips on the board to achieve the same capacity of RAM.

Omnia routers were manufactured in this revision only in configuration with
Wi-Fi and with 2GB of RAM.

!!!warning
    Some of the routers in this revision are missing GPIO ports, as they
    were temporarily dropped because of problems getting the required parts.

As a minor but user-noticeable change, this revision introduced blue buttons
instead of black ones.


## CZ11NIC23

Marked as Omnia 2019, Omnia 2020, and Omnia Wi-Fi 6 in retail.

It is the second revamp of the Turris Omnia board.

The user's most notable change is the color change of the chassis. The previous
black color was switched to metallic silver. It also comes preinstalled with
Turris OS 4.X, while previous versions were starting from 3.X version and had to
upgrade to 4.X first. Turris Omnia Wi-Fi 6 has preinstalled Turris OS 6.X.

This revision is manufactured only with Wi-Fi and 2GB of RAM, the same as
CZ11NIC20. It also may feature blue buttons instead of black ones in several
batches.


## CZ11NIC33

Marked as Omnia Wi-Fi 6, Omnia NO Wi-Fi, and Omnia 4G in retail.

It is the third revamp of the Turris Omnia board.

The user's most notable change is the SIM slot; the new one is much more
durable. There are also several minor hardware improvements.

This revision comes preinstalled with Turris OS 6.X. The newer series,
equipped with the MKL MCU chips, has preinstalled Turris OS 7.X.
