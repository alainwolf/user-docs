# GPIO (general purpose input-output ports)

GPIO ports are ports that can be controlled by a user program. Their location
and numbering on the board can be found [here](omnia-pinout.png).

Maximum electrical characteristics of GPIO ports:

|         |      |
|---------|------|
| Voltage | 3.3V |
| Current | Â±5mA |

!!! important
    When the electrical parameters are violated, proper function of ports
    is not guaranteed and the router can get damaged permanently!


## Shell

GPIO ports can be exported to the file system so they can be controlled by
a simple shell script as well.

The first step is to export the GPIO port which we will be working with.
This can be done by entering the port number into the `/sys/class/gpio/export`
file. An example for **GPIO18** follows:

```bash
echo 18 > /sys/class/gpio/export
```

After exporting the selected port, the `/sys/class/gpio/gpio**` folder is
created automatically where the asterisks are replaced with the number of
the GPIO port. For port 18, it is `/sys/class/gpio/gpio18`. The `direction`
and `value` files in particular can be found in this folder. The first of
these files determines whether the port is set as an input one, or as an
output one. The corresponding values in the file are `in` and `out`.
The function of the other file, `value`, depends on the setting in
the `direction` file. If the port is set as an input one , the `value`
file contains the current state of the port (`0` for the low voltage level
and `1` for the high voltage level) and it cannot be written to. If the port
is set as an output one, zero value can be written to the `value` file for
the low voltage level or a non-zero value for the high voltage level. It is
also possible to read the set value back in the same way as when the port
is set as an input one.

Setting the port as an input one and reading the state is therefore possible
in the following way:

```bash
echo in > direction
cat value
```

Setting the port as an output one and setting the high voltage level is
possible in the following way:

```bash
echo out > direction
echo 1 > value
```


## Python

Shell is sufficient in case of simpler operations but it is better to use
a full-fledged programming language like Python for more complex programs.
The GPIO Python library has been ported to Turris; originally, it was created
for Raspberry Pi. In order to use it, you need to install
the `python-turris-gpio` package first.

This guide only covers the basic use of the library. It does not describe all
the properties provided by the library. Further and more detailed information
can be found in the [documentation for the original version of the library](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/).

### Initialization

The first step to use this library is to import and initialize it. The library
is initialized in the _BCM_ mode where port numbers correspond to their
designations on the chip. This is the same as on the [pinout picture](omnia-pinout.png).

<!--gpio2-start-->

```python
import turris_gpio as gpio
gpio.setmode(gpio.BCM)
```

Next, we set the ports that we will control.

```python
gpio.setup(18, gpio.OUT)
gpio.setup(33, gpio.IN)
```

The first argument of the `setup` function is the port number and the second
argument is either `OUT` for an output port, or `IN` for an input port.


### Output

Ports that are set as the output ones can be then controlled using
the `output` function. This function accepts the port number as the first
parameter and the voltage level as the second one. It can be `True` for
the high level or `False` for the low one (alternatively also `0` or `gpio.LOW`
resp. `1` or `gpio.HIGH`).

An example is shown in the following code which sets the **GPIO18** port to
the high voltage level for the time interval of ten seconds:

```python
gpio.output(18, True)
time.sleep(10)
gpio.output(18, False)
```


### Input

The voltage level of the port set as an input one can be read using
the `input` function. It expects the port number as its only argument. Its
return value is `True` for the high voltage level and `False` for the low one.

An example of code that reads the state of the **GPIO33** port and writes it out follows:
```python
if gpio.input(33):
    print("Port 33 is HIGH")
else:
    print("Port 33 is LOW")
```

!!! info
    Pull-up/-down resistors that can be set through programs are not supported
    and it is recommended to use hardware ones instead.


### Waiting for a change of signal

In case your program only waits for a change of output, it is better to let
the operating system do the checking of the input and to put the program to
sleep instead of checking the input repeatedly (so called _busy loop_). This
can be done using this library by calling a single function named
`wait_for_edge`. This function expects at least two arguments. The first one
is the port number and the second one is either `RISING`, or `FALLING`, or
`BOTH`. The function suspends the program execution until there is a change
of signal from the low voltage level to the high one in case of `RISING`,
or a change from the high voltage level to the low one in case of `FALLING`,
or both changes in case of `BOTH`. The return value of the function is
the port number where the change was in effect.

Therefore, it is possible to use the following code for waiting for the leading
edge on **GPIO18**:

```python
port = gpio.wait_for_edge(18, gpio.RISING)
if port == 18:
    print("Leading edge on port 18")
else:
    print("This should never happen, there is no timeout and we are only waiting for port 18")
```

It is also possible to specify the maximum time of waiting for a change (so
called timeout) as the argument of the `wait_for_edge` function. It is time
in milliseconds. If the selected time is over and no change on the port has
been been observed, the function returns `None` instead of the port number.
The following example would apply to the **GPIO18** port:

```python
port = gpio.wait_for_edge(18, gpio.FALLING)
if port:
    print("Trailing edge on port " + str(port))
else:
    print("Time is over")
```


### Cleanup

Before exiting the program or when the port will not be worked with any more,
it is necessary to reset the state of the port in order to leave the library
cleaned up after using it. This can be done using the `cleanup` function.
It optionally accepts the number of the port which you are finishing your work
with as an argument. If the argument is not passed to the function, all ports
that have been set by the program are cleaned up.

Therefore, one of the following calls can be used for cleaning up all ports
(**GPIO18** and **GPIO33**) set at the beginning of this guide:

```python
gpio.cleanup([18, 33])
gpio.cleanup()
```
